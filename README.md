# Computational proteomics tools
## Introduction

Metaproteomics is the study of the proteins expressed in a cell, organism, or tissue. This includes protein identification and quantification (or quantitation), proteinâ€“protein interactions, protein complexes prediction, protein modifications and protein localization in the cell. Metaproteomics mostly utilizes methods originating from mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Mass spectrometry is a high performance instrument for molecular analysis, evidenced in part by the increasing number of biologists utilizing MS for protein identification, quantification, and characterization. Furthermore, Computational Proteomics is about the computational methods, algorithms, databases and methodologies used to process, manage, analyze and interpret the data produced in proteomics experiments. The broad application of proteomics in different biological and medical fields, as well as the diffusion of high-throughput platforms, leads to increasing volumes of available proteomics data requiring efficient algorithms, new data management capabilities and novel analysis, inference and visualization techniques. 

In the proteomics community, most of the tools start to use Python widely used around 2012 when several mature Python packages were published including pymzML, Pyteomics and pyOpenMS. This has led to an ever-increasing interest in the Python programming language in the proteomics and mass spectrometry community. The number of publications referencing or using Python has risen eight fold since 2012 (compared with the same time period before 2012), with multiple open-source Python packages now supporting mass spectrometric data analysis and processing. Computing and data analysis in mass spectrometry is very diverse and in many cases must be tailored to a specific experiment. Often, multiple analysis steps have to be performed (identification, quantification, post-translational modification analysis, filtering, FDR analysis etc.) in an analysis pipeline, which requires high flexibility in the analysis. This is where Python truly shines, due to its flexibility, visualization capabilities and the ability to extend computation with a large number of powerful libraries. Python can be used to quickly prototype software, combine existing libraries into powerful analysis workflows while avoiding the trap of re-inventing the wheel for a new project.

Here in this repository, you will find useful tools for processing, analysis, and identification and also visualization proteomics data.
